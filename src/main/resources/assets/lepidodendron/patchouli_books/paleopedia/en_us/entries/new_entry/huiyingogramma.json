			"text": "Kalligrammatids are large insects that diversified in the Cretaceous, which were extremely butterfly-like looking. However it is not related to butterflies at all, it is a neuropteran insect (lacewing) instead. Not only its appearance, but also its ecology resembled to that of butterflies. Most kalligrammatids had proboscis-like mouthparts, and they would used it to suck nectars from flowers, although mostly from gymnosperm. They would be important pollinators at that time, just like modern butterflies. Huiyingogramma is a genus of kalligrammatid lacewing from Jiulongshan Formation, Middle Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China. It had stripes and single large eyespot on its forewings."
