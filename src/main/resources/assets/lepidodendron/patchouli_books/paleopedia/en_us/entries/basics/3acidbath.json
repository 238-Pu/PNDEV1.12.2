An acid bath can operate with as many as 4 fossils at a time but will also accept less. Only some cleaning attempts will result in a cleaned fossil; others will result in various types of junk outputs."

Acid can be pumped into the bath via modded pipes, and there is a config option to require or not the use of RF Power for the machine. A redstone signal applied to the control panel will pause the acid bath. Finally the acid bath itself outputs a redstone comparator signal according to how full it is with acid."
