This exact species is a modern species but entirely similar to what has existed since ancient times. The lion's mane jellyfish is a large arctic jellyfish that lives in the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the North Sea and the English Channel. It uses its stinging tentacles to capture and eat prey such as fish, zooplankton and smaller jellyfish."
