			"text": "Among the most populous in the Asteroceratids, this ammonite could grow to relatively large sizes, with some of the largest specimens measuring up to 40 cm in shell diameter. The shell was slightly elongated when seen from the top and the whorls became visibly larger quite quickly as they developed, while ornamentation remained bare along its entire length, if not for the quite prominent ribs running along its sides and bottom,"
