			"text": "Belonostomus is a genus of Aspidorhynchid fish that existed worldwide between the Late Jurassic and the Paleocene.\nUsually not longer than 50 cm long, the animal was a very widespread predator characterized by its long body and rostrum, not too dissimilar from their close cousin Aspidorhynchus.\nThe genus was named by Agassiz in 1834 to accommodate the species B. tenuirostris, previously assigned to the genus Aspidorhynchus.\nB. kochii is but one of the several Jurassic species described from the famous locality of Solnhofen and its limestones; alongside it at least another three species come from the same area, mostly differentiated by the size and shape of their rostra."
