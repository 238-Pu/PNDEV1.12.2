The genus was comprised of 60 species, averaging around 30 centimeters in length. However, Bothriolepis rex was much larger, reaching estimated lengths of 170 centimeters! "

Specimens of this animal have been found preserving soft tissue, showing the gills, digestive system, and even rudimentary lungs, suggesting that Bothriolepis could breathe air!"
