The machine will start processing once the lid is closed and the centrifuge is balanced. The centrifuge will accept up to four phials of DNA although you can balance it using empty phials if necessary."

			"text": "You can use hoppers (and modded equivalents) to insert phials into the Centrifuge. You cannot extract already-centrifuged phials and the machine will remain locked until all centrifuged phials have been processed by the next stages. The machine will transfer the centrifuged DNA phial into the main DNA Forge part of the machine. This part needs to have a supply of oligopools in order to process the phial."
