The machine will start processing once the lid is closed and the centrifuge is balanced. The centrifuge will accpt up to four phials of DNA although you can balance using empty phials if necessary. You can use hoppers (and modded equivalents) to insert phials into the Centrifuge. You cannot extract alread-centrifuged phials and the machine will remain locked until all centrifuged phials have been processed by the next stages."

You can use hoppers (and modded equivalents) to insert oligopools into the DNA Forge, and to extract completed DNA from it. Once complete the DNA Forge will produce a placeable cultured DNA item to create the living thing."
