			"text": "Bivalves are marine and freshwater molluscs with compressed bodies protected by an outer shell which consists of two hinged parts. They have gills and the majority are filter feeders. Many bivalves will bury themselves into the sediment in order to protect from predators. The first organisms to cover themselves in these kinds of shells originated in the Cambrian, although are more recognisably bivalves from the Ordovician period onward, when they started to form important parts of reef-building on and off over the succeeding periods."
