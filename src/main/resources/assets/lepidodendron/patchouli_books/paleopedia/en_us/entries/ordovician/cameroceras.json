			"text": "Cameroceras (chambered horn) is a giant orthocone which lived during the Ordovician to Silurian periods. Cameroceras (originally erected in the 1840s for C. trentonense) has become a wastebasket taxon which has also been used to hold many different types of large to very large, straight-shelled endocerid nautiloids. These inhabited shallow seas and became very diverse during the Upper Ordovician but did not recover their diversity after the Ordovician-Silurian extinction event. They may have been ambush predators that lunged at prey and consumed them."
