			"text": "Variable in size, the largest species could grow up to 2 meters in length with a deeply lunate tail characteristic of fast swimming predators. Due to its huge stratigraphic range, spanning 120 million years, and differences in size and shape, it's unlikely Caturus was monophyletic, meaning some of the animals we call Caturus today might've been something different."
