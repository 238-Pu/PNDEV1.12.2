Latex is a gummy fluid which is able to be crafted into rubber items, such as special boots to avoid you getting stuck on mud blocks. To obtain these fluids, you extract them from certain trees using a fluid extractor."

An extractor can hold up to 2000 millibuckets of fluid (one bucket = 1000 millibuckets; one glass bottle = 333 millibuckets). To get the fluid out of the extractor, right click it with an empty bucket or empty glass bottle. An untended extractor may overflow."
