To obtain resin, you extract it from trees using a resin extractor. This machine should be placed up against a tree of suitable size and type (various conifers). After a while the extractor will slowly start to fill with resin."

An extractor can hold up to 2000 millibuckets of resin (one bucket = 1000 millibuckets; one glass bottle = 333 millibuckets). To get the resin out of the extractor, right click it with an empty bucket or empty glass bottle. An untended extractor may overflow."
