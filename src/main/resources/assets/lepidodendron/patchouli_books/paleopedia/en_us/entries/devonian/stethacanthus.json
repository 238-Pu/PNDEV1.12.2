Much like its relative Akmonistion, Stethacanthus had a rather unusually shaped first dorsal fin, superficially resembling an anvil or an ironing board. Small spikes or large denticles adorned the top of the dorsal fin,"

It's worth noting that these structures were only present in males, suggesting they served some purpose relating to courtship, perhaps either as display or as an aid in mating. The relatively small body fins and teeth of Stethacanthus suggest that it may have been a bottom-dweller."
