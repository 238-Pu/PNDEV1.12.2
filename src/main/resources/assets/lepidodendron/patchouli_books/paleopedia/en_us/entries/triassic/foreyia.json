Forey, and Max Kuhn who prepared many fossils from the region of Switzerland where this Foreyia was discovered (including fossils of the animal itself). Despite being in the same family as the modern coelacanth (Latimeriidae), Foreyia's anatomy was rather unusual by comparison: Its head was proportionately enormous, its maxilla (upper jaw) was beak-like, and it had an underbite."
