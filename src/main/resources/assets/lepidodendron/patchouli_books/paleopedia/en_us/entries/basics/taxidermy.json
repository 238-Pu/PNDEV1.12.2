Acting both as decoration blocks and as a way to be able to enjoy the models without them moving constantly, this system allows for the display of the vast majority of non-static animals in the mod."

There are several display bases broadly used for certain animal groups. Display cases are for invertebrates up to a block large and small Cambrian early fishes like Haikouichthys. Plinths are useful for small terrestrial animals and large Eurypterids."

Simply right clicking with the appropriate item in hand on the right base will show the model of the animal. If the base is wrong, the item will be shown in a similar fashion to a vanilla item frame."

ONce you have supplied your table with those items, you can then add your raw meat from the mob to craft a Taxidermy Kit which can be placed into the various display options as above. "
