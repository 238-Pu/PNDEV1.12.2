If you place a trap in a biome and bait it it will be able to catch creatures whose diets match the bait. If there are no available creatures, the trap will tell you:"

Once the trap has caught something, you can release it automatically by applying a redstone signal to the trap (eg. a button or lever, etc), or you can click the trap with a jar, cage or bucket to catch the mob as appropriate. A full trap also powers a comparator output."
