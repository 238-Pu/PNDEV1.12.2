			"text": "Mixopterus is a genus of eurypterid from the late Silurian period. Its claws were laced with spines for grasping and catching prey. It also had paddle like appendages meaning it was a good swimmer. Mixopertus probably mated in a similar fashion to horseshoe crabs as there are preserved evidence of its reproductive glands. Mixopterus may have also been able to walk on the ocean floor with its middle 2 specialized limbs."
