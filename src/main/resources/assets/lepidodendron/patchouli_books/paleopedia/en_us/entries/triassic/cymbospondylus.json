			"text": "Cymbospondylus is a genus of basal Ichthyosaur from the Middle Triassic from Europe and North America. Able to reach massive sizes up to 14 m long if not more, the genus was quite widespread in the Triassic oceans. Due to its size and shape of the tail, it is believed Cymbospondylus was an ambush predator, able to gain sudden bursts of speed to catch up to prey."

			"text": "The stomach contents of a specimen found in Switzerland preserve exclusively remains of cephalopod hooks, which fueled the hypothesis of Cymbospondylus being a cephalopod specialist, an idea that has been criticised by many. A specimen preserving what seem to be three fetuses also lends credit to the idea that even this early on in their evolution, ichthyosaurs couldâ€™ve already been live bearers."
