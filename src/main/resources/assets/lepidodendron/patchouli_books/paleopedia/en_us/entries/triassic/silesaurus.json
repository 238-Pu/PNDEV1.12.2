			"text": "Silesaurus opolensis was a species of silesaurid dinosauriform (though not a true dinosaur) that lived during the Late Triassic (around 224 - 209 million years ago). Its remains have been found in the Keuper Claystone of Krasiej√≥w, Poland. This lightly built, likely fast-moving animal was initially thought to have been herbivorous, but later research on coprolites attributed to this animal suggest that it may actually have been an insectivore. In these coprolites, a new beetle named Triamyxa coprolithica, was discovered and described."
